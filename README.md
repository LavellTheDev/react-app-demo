# React Full Stack Barista App

It's a gag app, don't take the styling very seriously it is something I whipped up very late at night and thought it was very funny. The functionality of the app works and is what is really on display here.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, React

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

The most interesting part was grasping how the back end works. It happened through trail and error. When creating a view and connecting the routes. While updating the browser I received an error message couldn't /get. After getting that message it became clear how the routes and views work and how to connect them to display what it is I would like for my user to see.

## Examples:
